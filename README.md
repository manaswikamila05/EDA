# Exploratory Data Analysis 


Exploratory data analysis uses data visualisation techniques to draw inferences and obtain insights from them. However, EDA is much more than plotting graphs or visualising data, it is more about understanding and studying the given data in detail. Visualisation of data into plots/graphs can be termed one of the tools in the EDA process. 

EDA also involves the preparation of data sets for analysis by removing irregularities in the data so that these irregularities do not affect further steps in the process of data analysis and machine learning model building.

Utility of EDA
- Maximise the insight in the data set
- Detect outliers and anomalies
- Test underlying assumptions

It does not involve merely finding irregularities in the data, such as missing values or outliers; it is a combination of fixing the data set for useful purposes and then deriving maximum insights from that data, by either plotting graphs or using statistical parameters.

EDA should be the first step in any data science / machine learning activity. Based on the results of EDA, companies also make business decisions, which can have repercussions later. Hence, we observe the following: 
- If not performed properly, EDA can hamper the further steps in the machine learning model building process.
- If done well, it may improve the efficacy of all we do in the next steps.
